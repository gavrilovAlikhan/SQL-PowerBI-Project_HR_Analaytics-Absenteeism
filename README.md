# HR Analytics Absenteeism Project - SQL & Power BI
This project involves analysing employee absenteeism, health, and lifestyle data to create a comprehensive database and interactive Power BI dashboard. The aim is to identify candidates for a bonus program based on health metrics and calculate wage increases for non-smokers. Steps include importing data into SQL Server, optimising queries, and designing visuals following a HR wireframe. Interactive filters and a smart narrative section will enhance data interpretation.
